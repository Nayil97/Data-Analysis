## Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. Understanding these segments helps tailor marketing strategies effectively, optimize efforts, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
- To analyze and understand customer purchasing behavior
- To segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior
- To provide actionable recommendations for targeted marketing

 ## Dataset

 The dataset contains customer data with various features such as balance, purchases, credit limit, payments, and more.

 ## Technologies Used
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Sciklit-Learn

## Analysis Process
### 1. Data Undestanding
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Handle missing values
### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Feature engineering to create new relevant features
- Scale the features for clustering
### 3. Clustering Analysis
- Use the Elbow method and Silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Perform K-Means clustering
- Profile each cluster to understand its characteristics
### 4. Visualization
- Visualize the clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Generate scatter plots to show customer segments
## Results and Findings

The clustering analysis resulted in four distinct customer segments:
- Cluster 0: Low activity customers with minimal financial activity
- Cluster 1: High spenders with substantial financial activity and high credit limits
- Cluster 2: Moderate spenders with average behavior in terms of balances, purchases, and credit use
- Cluster 3: Customers who prefer installment purchases over one-off purchases
## Business Recommendations

Based on the customer segments, the following recommendations are made:
- High Spenders (Cluster 1): Offer exclusive rewards and incentives for high spending behavior
- Moderate Spenders (Cluster 2): Provide personalized offers to encourage higher spending
- Installment Users (Cluster 3): Promote installment plans with low interest rates
- Low Activity Customers (Cluster 0): Develop engagement strategies to increase their activity
## Conclusion

The customer segmentation analysis provides valuable insights into different customer groups. By implementing targeted marketing strategies and optimizing product offerings based on these insights, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction and improve overall performance.
